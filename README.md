# ViaSnapshot
### ⚠️ WARNING: This is experimental and is not safe to use on public servers. Use at your own risk!
**Allows you to join servers from snapshots, using ViaProxy. Currently only supports 15w31a.**

Known Issues:
- Item Drops are stone
- Entity metadata is missing
- Item interaction in newer versions is broken
- Some servers kick on join (either byte issues or json error)
- Newer servers kick on beacon activation
- And more, possibly on purpose as some packets were disabled

This is just a fun project I did and will possibly continue depending on my skill and knowledge.
