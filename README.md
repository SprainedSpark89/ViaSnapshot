Known Issues:

- And more, possibly on purpose as some packets were disabled

## Installation and Usage

1. Download the latest version from [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/ViaVersionAddons/ViaSnapshot/actions).
2. Put the jar file into the plugins folder of ViaProxy
3. Run ViaProxy. You should now be able to connect from a snapshot client to ViaProxy.

This is just a fun project I did and will possibly continue depending on my skill and knowledge.
